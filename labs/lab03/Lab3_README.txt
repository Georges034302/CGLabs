## Lab 3 - Matrix Operations
# In this lab we will reuse the lab02 files [setup.js, build.js, animate.js, run.js] 
# and update these files to create a set of cubes that rotates around the Y axis as a group.
# setup.js is unchanged
# build.js should be modified [follow in-code comments]
# animate.js should be modified [follow in-code comments]
# run.js is unchanged
